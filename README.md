# Bayesian-Inference

### Description:
Here is some of the code I wrote during a course of Bayesian Inference during my studies. 

### Aim:
to master the basis of Bayesian inference and the required tools  to address the problems of parametric estimation, predictive inference and hypothesis testing according to the Bayesian viewpoint.

### Discussed topics and used algorithms: 
prior probability, posterior probability, likelihood, conditional distribution, Bayes theorem, Classical vs Bayesian framework, conjugate priors, Monte Carlo simulation, Monte Carlo Markov chains, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, hyperpriors, model assumptions,  Gelman and Rubin statistic, checking convergence with traceplot and autocorrelation function, effective sample size, Posterior Predictive Distribution (PPD), Bayesian p-value, AIC and BIC, Informative priors, flat priors.
